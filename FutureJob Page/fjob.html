        <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
        <p>
          The professional in charge of the UI will focus on the design of the product, impacting the first visual 
          impression of the user, something that determines if the website or application is to their liking, while 
          the person in charge of the UX focuses on usability and easy navigation, creating certain emotions and 
          sensations when using the interface. Another way of saying it: the UI designer is primarily responsible for 
          the visual aspect of the interface, while the UX focuses on ensuring that the navigation and actions performed 
          by the user are consistent, the UI is responsible for deciding the user's journey, while the UX focuses on the 
          processes and actions that trigger the use.

        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. 
          Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when 
          a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality. It ensures that the application 
          is built consistently, correctly, on time and on budget and within requirements. The demand of software 
          engineering also emerged to cater to the immense rate of change in user requirements and environment on which 
          application is supposed to be working.

        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>
          Web Developers create and maintain websites. They will typically spend time creating coding languages like HTML5, 
          which powers many modern mobile devices and managing the site's technical aspects, such as its performance and 
          capacity to handle traffic without crashing.
          They are in charge of ensuring websites to look good and function properly. Web developers collaborate with website 
          and graphic designers, monitor website traffic, troubleshoot website problems when they arise, and update websites 
          as necessary. Web Developers typically work in teams that include other Web Developers, Software Developers, Web 
          Designers and IT professionals. However, since they are often at the forefront of new technology, Web Developers 
          can work closely with various individuals from different disciplines.
